# Weather-App.github.io
A Weather App that displays the Local weather, weather map (weather map service) and weather widgets worldwide with the help of an API as well as gives an option to search for a particular country and state to get their weather condition.
This Weather App project I used "OPENWEATHERMAP" API. Here I used HTML, CSS and JS.
The website is currently hosted at : https://pritomdutta89.github.io/Weather-App.github.io/
